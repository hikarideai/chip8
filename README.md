# chip8 [WIP]
CHIP8 emulation software written with purely academic intention.

... or maybe not.

##### I feel no obligation to continue working on the project, as the core -- emulation -- part is fully operational. The TUI I have resonated will to create is just an artifact of my destructive ambition. Although, it will be made someday, this CHIP8 project is over for me.
